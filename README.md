A comprehensive Python package for analyzing US coal plant retirement strategies based on contextual vulnerabilities. This package implements methods and provides data from the research paper *"Strategies to Accelerate US Coal Power Phaseout Using Contextual Retirement Vulnerabilities"* published in Nature Energy.

## üî• Key Features

- **üìä Rich Dataset**: Complete US coal plant data with operational characteristics, retirement status, and contextual factors
- **üï∏Ô∏è Network Analysis**: Tools for analyzing plant relationships using similarity-based network graphs
- **üìà Visualization Suite**: Comprehensive plotting capabilities including network graphs, geographic maps, heatmaps, and interactive visualizations
- **üî¨ Research Reproducibility**: Direct access to manuscript results and analysis outputs
- **‚ö° Easy Installation**: Simple pip installation with minimal dependencies

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install retire
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from retire import Retire, Explore

# Initialize the analysis objects
retire_obj = Retire()
explore = Explore(retire_obj.graph, retire_obj.raw_df)

# Access the coal plant dataset
df = retire_obj.raw_df
print(f"Dataset contains {len(df)} coal plants")

# Visualize the network graph
fig, ax = explore.drawGraph(col='ret_STATUS', show_colorbar=True)

# Create an interactive geographic map
fig, ax = explore.drawMap()

# Get manuscript analysis results
group_analysis = retire_obj.get_group_report()
plant_explanations = retire_obj.get_target_explanations()
```

## üìñ Package Overview

### Main Classes

#### `Retire`
The main analysis class providing access to coal plant data and manuscript results.

```python
retire = Retire()

# Access raw coal plant dataset
df = retire.raw_df

# Access network graph
G = retire.graph

# Get group-level analysis from manuscript
groups = retire.get_group_report()

# Get plant-level targeting explanations
explanations = retire.get_target_explanations()
```

#### `Explore`
Comprehensive visualization toolkit for exploring coal plant networks and retirement patterns.

```python
explore = Explore(retire.graph, retire.raw_df)

# Network visualizations
explore.drawGraph(col='Age')                    # Color nodes by plant age
explore.drawComponent(0, col='ret_STATUS')      # Visualize specific component
explore.drawPathDistance(0, targets, distances) # Show distances to targets

# Statistical visualizations
explore.drawHeatMap(heatmap_config)             # Grouped feature heatmap
explore.drawDotPlot(clean_df, dotplot_config)   # Feature comparison plot
explore.drawBar()                               # Plant count bar chart
explore.drawSankey()                            # Flow diagram

# Geographic visualizations
explore.drawMap()                               # Interactive US map
explore.drawComponentsMap()                     # Component-wise map
```

### Data Loading Functions

```python
from retire.data import (
    load_dataset,                    # Raw coal plant dataset
    load_clean_dataset,             # Cleaned and scaled data
    load_projection,                # Projected retirement data
    load_generator_level_dataset,   # Generator-level details
    load_graph                      # Network graph
)
```

## üéØ Use Cases

### Research & Analysis
- **Academic Research**: Reproduce and extend findings from the Nature Energy paper
- **Policy Analysis**: Understand coal plant retirement vulnerabilities and strategic targeting
- **Network Science**: Analyze plant relationships using graph-based methods

### Visualization & Communication
- **Interactive Maps**: Explore geographic patterns of coal plant retirement
- **Network Graphs**: Visualize plant clusters and relationships
- **Statistical Plots**: Compare plant characteristics across groups

### Data Access

## üìä Dataset Description

The package includes several interconnected datasets:

| Dataset | Description | Access Function |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Raw Coal Data** | Original US coal plants with plant and generator information | `load_dataset()` |
| **Clean Data** | Processed and scaled dataset ready for analysis | `load_clean_dataset()` |
| **Projections** | Future retirement projections and scenarios | `load_projection()` |
| **Generator Level** | Detailed generator-level operational data | `load_generator_level_dataset()` |
| **Network Graph** | Plant similarity network with nodes and edges | `load_graph()` |

### Key Variables
- **Plant Characteristics**: Capacity, age, efficiency, fuel type
- **Retirement Status**: Current retirement plans and timeline
- **Environmental**: Emissions, environmental justice metrics
- **Economic**: Operating costs, retrofit investments, market conditions  
- **Political**: Public opinion, legislative context
- **Geographic**: Location, regional energy mix

## üé® Visualization Examples

### Network Graph
```python
# Visualize plant network colored by retirement status
fig, ax = explore.drawGraph(
    col='ret_STATUS',
    show_colorbar=True,
    size=(12, 8)
)
```
